Hello! 

This is my Cv website. 

It is almost fully funtional, apart from som dead buttons in the portfolio/projects sections. The buttons for projects CSS Grid & Java Joke will direct the user to small projects.

The contact page's layout is almost done, but not funtional at all. I will update this with javascript later. 

Unsure if dropdown menu works as expected in mobile view, aka if the hover pseudo class is the same as clicked.
